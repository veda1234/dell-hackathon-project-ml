# Dell Hackathon Project

This project was made as a part of a Hackathon held by <b>Dell Technologies Ltd.</b>

The theme for the hackathon was ‘Machine Learning’ and a set of topics were given. My team chose to develop a predictive algorithm to do market forecasting 
for products of Dell. The framework that we chose for this project was Flask which helped immensely in 
integrating all the aspects of the project. Laptops were chosen as the product and the aim was to predict the sales of a new technology-based laptop. 

After a lot of research, we used an innovative potential model for assigning scores to the new technology that the laptop would have. The algorithm was a success 
and got good reviews from the Dell engineers who had come to assess us.
